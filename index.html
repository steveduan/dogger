        <p> &quot;Fight, and you may die. Run, and you'll live at least a while. 
       And dying in your beds many years from now. Would you be willing 
       to trade? All the days from this day to that, for one chance, just 
       one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take 
       our lives, but they'll never take our Freedom!Â &quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.
         "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am a
         n automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel
          of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from 
          my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I a
          m souless and heartless? You think wrong!--I have as much soul as you,--
          and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and muc
          h wealth!&quot;</p>

        &quot;Life is a chess-board The chess-board is the world: the pieces are the pheno
        mena of the universe; the rules of the game are what we call the laws of na
        ture. The player on the other side is hidden from us. We know that his play 
        is always fair, just and patient. But also we know, to our cost, that he neve
         overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance.&quot;
